# MongoDB updateOne() Silent Failure on Non-Existent Nested Fields

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in MongoDB's `updateOne()` method. When attempting to update a nested field that does not exist in some documents, the operation fails silently without throwing an error. This behavior can lead to unexpected data inconsistencies and debugging challenges.

## Bug Description
The provided JavaScript code uses MongoDB's `updateOne()` method to update a nested field ("address.street"). If the "address" field or the "street" field within it does not exist in a particular document, the operation will not produce an error, instead it will simply not update the document. This makes it difficult to identify the root cause of the failed update.

## Solution
The solution involves using the `$setOnInsert` operator to handle cases where the nested field might not exist. This ensures that the update operation will only affect documents where the nested field already exists, and prevents unexpected behavior when the field is absent.
